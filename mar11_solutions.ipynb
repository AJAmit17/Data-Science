    "The t-test and the z-test are both statistical hypothesis tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. However, they differ in certain aspects, including the conditions under which they are appropriate and the type of data they are used for.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. T-test:\n",
    "The t-test is used when the sample size is small or when the population standard deviation is unknown. It is specifically designed to test hypotheses about the mean of a population based on a small sample. The t-test uses the t-distribution, which takes into account the added uncertainty introduced by estimating the population standard deviation from the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario: Let's say you want to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean scores of two groups of students who received different teaching methods. You randomly select 20 students from each group and measure their test scores. Since the sample sizes are relatively small and the population standard deviation is unknown, you would use a t-test to compare the means of the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Z-test:\n",
    "The z-test is used when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30) or when the population standard deviation is known. It assumes that the sampling distribution follows a standard normal distribution, which is appropriate when the sample size is large enough for the central limit theorem to apply.\n",

You randomly sample 100 adult males from the country and measure their heights. Since the sample size is relatively large, and if the population standard deviation is known or can be reasonably estimated, you would use a z-test to compare the sample mean to the known population mean."

    "\n",
    "1. One-tailed test:\n",
    "In a one-tailed test, the alternative hypothesis specifies a directional difference or relationship between variables. It tests whether the sample data significantly supports the claim that a parameter is either greater than or less than a certain value. The critical region for the test is defined on only one side of the sampling distribution.\n",

    "In a two-tailed test, the alternative hypothesis does not specify a particular direction of difference or relationship.
