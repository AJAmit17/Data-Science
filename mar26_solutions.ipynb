    "The assumptions of linear regression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity: There should be a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. This means that the change in the response variable should be proportional to the change in the predictor variable. This assumption can be checked visually by creating a scatterplot of the data and looking for a linear trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independence: The observations should be independent of each other, i.e., the value of the response variable for one observation should not be influenced by the value of the response variable for another observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the predictor variable. This means that the spread of the residuals should be consistent across the range of the predictor variable. This assumption can be checked visually by creating a scatterplot of the residuals against the predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Normality: The residuals should be normally distributed. This means that the errors should be normally distributed with a mean of zero and constant variance. This assumption can be checked using a normal probability plot or a histogram of the residuals.\n",

    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, one can:\n",

    "1. Create a scatterplot of the data to check for linearity.\n",

    "The slope and intercept in a linear regression model are coefficients that help predict the relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intercept, also known as the y-intercept or constant term, is the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis. It represents the expected value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is equal to zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "The slope, also known as the regression coefficient, represents the rate of change in the dependent variable with respect to a change in the independent variable. It tells us how much the dependent variable changes for every one unit change in the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we are trying to predict the salary of an individual based on their years of experience, the intercept would represent the expected salary for someone with zero years of experience (which is usually not applicable in this scenario), and the slope would represent how much the salary would increase for every additional year of experience. In this case, a slope of 5000 would indicate that for every one year of experience, the salary increases by $5000.\n",

    "So, the slope and intercept are important in interpreting the linear relationship between the two variables and can help make predictions based on a given independent variable."

    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning to find the optimal parameters or coefficients for a model. It is a gradient-based optimization technique that aims to minimize the cost or error function of a model by iteratively adjusting the parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "In gradient descent, the algorithm starts with an initial set of parameters and calculates the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters. The gradient indicates the direction of steepest increase in the cost function, and the algorithm adjusts the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient to reduce the cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process is repeated iteratively until the cost function reaches a minimum or converges to a stable value. Gradient descent uses a learning rate or step size to control the amount of parameter adjustment at each iteration.

In simple linear regression, there is only one variable that is used to predict the outcome, whereas in multiple linear regression there are multiple variables, and the formula includes multiple beta coefficients to weight each variable."

    "Multicollinearity in multiple linear regression refers to the situation where the independent variables (predictors) are highly correlated amongst themselves. This high correlation can lead to unstable estimates of the coefficients, reduced statistical significance, and difficulties in interpreting the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To detect multicollinearity, one can use correlation coefficients between each pair of independent variables. If the correlation coefficients are high (close to 1), it indicates that the independent variables are highly collinear. Additionally, one can also use techniques such as Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) or Eigenvalues to detect multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address multicollinearity, one can either remove one or more highly correlated predictors or combine highly correlated predictors. This can lead to a more stable and interpretable model. Another option is to use regularization techniques such as Ridge regression or Lasso regression, which can handle multicollinearity by introducing a penalty term in the regression equation."

Linear regression can be viewed as a special case of polynomial regression, where the degree of the polynomial is 1.\n",

This means that the model can capture more complex relationships between the variables, compared to linear regression, which can only model linear relationships.\n",

    "However, one disadvantage of polynomial regression is that it is more prone to overfitting, where the model fits the training data too closely and is unable to generalize well to new data. To avoid overfitting in polynomial regression, regularization techniques such as Ridge or Lasso regression can be used."
