If the file does not exist, it will be created. If the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten.\n",

This function is provided by most programming languages to release the resources used by the file, such as memory and system file handles.So it is important to close a file after it is no longer needed to free up system resources, ensure data integrity, and allow other programs to access the file. The close() function is used to close a file and should be called whenever a program is finished using a file."

    "The advantage of using the with statement with open() is that it ensures that the file is properly closed, even if an exception occurs while the file is being processed. If you don't use the with statement and there is an error in your code, the file might remain open and the data could be corrupted or lost.\n",

Additionally, it makes your code more portable, since the with statement works on different operating systems and file systems."
