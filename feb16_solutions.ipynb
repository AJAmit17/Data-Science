    "A database is an organized collection of structured data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Databases are used to store information that can be easily retrieved and used for various purposes such as data analysis, business intelligence, and decision-making. There are different types of databases, but two major categories are SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data. SQL databases are typically used for applications that require complex queries, data consistency, and data integrity. In SQL databases, data is stored in tables, and relationships between tables are defined using foreign keys. Examples of SQL databases include Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that do not use SQL as their primary query language. Instead, NoSQL databases use a variety of data models such as document-based, key-value, and graph-based models. NoSQL databases are typically used for applications that require scalability, flexibility, and high performance. NoSQL databases can handle unstructured data, and they can scale horizontally, which means they can add more nodes to increase their capacity. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between SQL and NoSQL databases is in their data models and query languages. SQL databases are relational databases that use SQL as their primary query language, while NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that use a variety of data models and query languages. The choice of database depends on the specific needs of an application, and the type of data being stored and queried."

In most cases, the primary key is a single column that has a unique value for each row. However, a primary key can also consist of multiple columns in some cases.\n",

    "A foreign key is a column in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to create relationships between two or more tables, which is one of the fundamental principles of relational database design. A foreign key constraint is a rule that ensures that the values in the foreign key column of one table match the values in the primary key column of another table."

    "\n",
    "5. HAVING: The HAVING clause is executed after the GROUP BY clause. It is similar to the WHERE clause, but it filters groups rather than individual rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. SELECT: The SELECT clause is executed after the HAVING clause. It specifies the columns to be included in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. DISTINCT: If the query includes a DISTINCT clause, it is executed after the SELECT clause. It removes duplicate rows from the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is executed after the SELECT or DISTINCT clause. It sorts the result set by one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. LIMIT/OFFSET: If the query includes a LIMIT or OFFSET clause, it is executed last. It limits the number of rows returned by the query and/or skips a certain number of rows in the result set."
