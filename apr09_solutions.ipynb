    "Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula that calculates the probability of an event occurring based on new information that may change the initial probability estimation. It is named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th century statistician and theologian who first proposed the theorem. The formula is expressed as: \n",

    "P(A|B) = P(B|A) x P(A) / P(B)\n",

    "Bayes' theorem is a formula for calculating conditional probabilities, which are the probabilities that an event will occur given some other known or assumed event has occurred. Specifically, Bayes' theorem uses conditional probabilities to update prior knowledge or beliefs about the likelihood of an event. Thus, Bayes' theorem and conditional probability are closely related since Bayes' theorem relies on conditional probabilities as a fundamental concept."

In general, Multinomial Naive Bayes performs well on text classification problems, while Gaussian Naive Bayes is often used for classification of numerical data."
