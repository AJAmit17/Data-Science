    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. Here's how each measure is used and an example to illustrate their interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Range:\n",
    "The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It provides a rough estimate of the spread but is sensitive to extreme values. A larger range indicates a greater spread, while a smaller range suggests a more concentrated distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider two datasets of exam scores:\n",
    "- Dataset A: [70, 75, 80, 85, 90]\n",
    "- Dataset B: [50, 55, 60, 95, 100]\n",
    "\n",
    "Both datasets have a range of 20 since the difference between the largest and smallest values is 20. However, Dataset B has a wider spread due to the presence of extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance:\n",
    "Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It considers all values in the dataset and provides a more comprehensive assessment of the spread. A higher variance indicates greater variability, while a lower variance suggests less dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider two datasets of student ages (in years) in two different schools:\n",
    "- Dataset A: [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]\n",
    "- Dataset B: [11, 12, 13, 17, 18]\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance for Dataset A is 2, while the variance for Dataset B is 7.2. This indicates that Dataset B has a higher spread of ages compared to Dataset A.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation:\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average deviation of each data point from the mean and is commonly used due to its intuitive interpretation. Similar to the variance, a higher standard deviation indicates greater variability, while a lower standard deviation suggests less dispersion.\n",

    "- Dataset B: [5, 10, 3, 8, 6]\n",

It indicates how changes in one variable are associated with changes in the other variable. However, the magnitude of covariance is not standardized, making it difficult to compare across different datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "- Mean: Outliers can have a substantial effect on the mean. Since the mean is sensitive to extreme values, even a single outlier can pull the mean towards it. Consequently, the mean may no longer represent the typical value of the dataset accurately.\n",
    "- Median: Outliers have minimal impact on the median. The median is resistant to extreme values since it represents the middle value when the data is sorted. Therefore, outliers do not affect the median significantly, and it provides a more robust measure of central tendency in the presence of outliers.\n",
    "- Mode: Outliers typically have no direct effect on the mode. The mode represents the most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset and is not influenced by extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "- Range: Outliers can significantly impact the range. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. If an outlier is present, it can increase or decrease the range, depending on whether it is larger or smaller than the other data points.\n",
    "- Variance: Outliers can have a notable effect on the variance. The variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. Outliers, especially if they are distant from the mean, can increase the variance significantly.\n",
    "- Standard Deviation: Like variance, outliers can significantly impact the standard deviation. The standard deviation measures the dispersion of data points around the mean. If outliers are present, they can increase the standard deviation, indicating greater variability in the dataset.\n",

    "- Median: The median remains unaffected by the outlier since it represents the middle value when the data is sorted. In this case, the median remains 90.\n",
