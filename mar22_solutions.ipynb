    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient, you need to compute the covariance between the two variables and their standard deviations. Once you have these values, you can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "r = covariance / (stdev of x * stdev of y)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Pearson correlation coefficient is positive, it indicates a positive linear relationship between the two variables, meaning that as one variable increases, the other also tends to increase. If the correlation coefficient is negative, it indicates a negative linear relationship, meaning that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. When the correlation coefficient is close to 0, it suggests that there is no clear linear relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation of the result will depend on the value of r. The range of the correlation coefficient is -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time spent studying and final exam scores is 0.8, it suggests a strong positive linear relationship between the variables. This means that students who spend more time studying tend to score better on the final exam. On the other hand, if the correlation coefficient is -0.5, it suggests a moderate negative linear relationship, which means that students who spend less time studying tend to score better on the final exam."

In other words, we need to assign a rank of 1 to the smallest value, a rank of 2 to the second smallest value, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have ranked both variables, we can calculate the difference in ranks for each individual. For example, if someone has a rank of 3 for their amount of sleep and a rank of 7 for their job satisfaction, the difference in ranks is -4. We square each of these differences, add them together, and multiply by 6, which is a constant value used in the calculation.\n",

This indicates a moderate negative relationship between the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job satisfaction level. In other words, as the amount of sleep decreases, job satisfaction tends to decrease as well. However, we cannot conclude that one variable causes the other - this correlation does not necessarily mean that getting more sleep will lead to higher job satisfaction."
