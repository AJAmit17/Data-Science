    "An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, the program execution will be halted and an error message will be displayed describing the cause of the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when the code is not written according to the rules of the programming language. These errors are detected by the Python interpreter when it tries to compile the code, and the program will not execute until the syntax errors are corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution of the program, while syntax errors occur during the compilation phase. Exceptions are also more specific in terms of their cause, and can be caught and handled by the program to allow for more graceful error handling. Syntax errors, on the other hand, must be fixed by adjusting the code, as they prevent the program from executing at all."

    "1. `try` and `else` blocks are used in exception handling in Python. When an exception occurs within a `try` block, the code inside the `except` block is executed. If no exception occurs, the code inside the `else` block is executed. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is:\", num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the user is prompted to enter a number. If they enter an incorrect value (e.g. a non-numeric character), a `ValueError` exception is raised and the message \"Invalid input.\" is printed. If the user enters a valid number, the message \"The number is: [num]\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A `finally` block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # some code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except SomeException:\n",
    "    # handle the exception\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # some cleanup code that always runs\n",

    "In this example, if an exception is raised inside the `try` block, the code inside the `except` block is executed. Regardless of whether an exception was raised or not, the code inside the `finally` block is always executed.\n",

    "3. The `raise` statement is used to raise an exception in Python. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "```\n",

    "In this example, the `divide` function raises a `ValueError` exception if the second argument (`b`) is zero. Otherwise, it returns the result of dividing `a` by `b`."

    "print(transfer_money(5000, 3000)) # Output - NotEnoughBalanceError: Insufficient balance in account.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
