    "Ordinal encoding involves converting categorical variables with an inherent order or hierarchy into numerical values. For example, converting sizes such as small, medium, and large into 1, 2, and 3 respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, label encoding involves assigning a unique numerical value to each category in a categorical variable. For example, converting colors such as red, blue, and green into 1, 2, and 3 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "One might choose ordinal encoding when there is a natural order to the categories, such as the example of sizes given above. Label encoding can be used when there is no inherent order to the categories, and a simple numerical mapping is required for making predictions or analysis, such as in the case of different colors of fruits.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that when using label encoding, some models may misinterpret the numerical values as having a meaningful order, even if it was not originally intended. In general, it's important to consider the specific use case and the nature of the categorical data before deciding which encoding method to use."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used for encoding categorical features in a dataset where the encoding is based on the target variable. In this technique, each category of a categorical variable is assigned an integer value based on the target variable's mean or median value of that particular category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps for performing Target Guided Ordinal Encoding are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean or median target value for each category of a categorical feature.\n",
    "2. Sort the categories based on their mean or median target value and assign an integer value to each category starting from 1.\n",
    "3. Replace the categorical feature values with the assigned integer values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we have a categorical feature \"City\" with categories such as New York City, San Francisco, and Chicago, and we want to predict the salary of a person based on the city. We can calculate the mean salary for each city and encode the categories based on their mean salary values. This will make our model more predictive.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding when we have categorical features with a high cardinality and want to incorporate the target variable's information in our model. This technique is useful when we want to avoid the risk of overfitting in decision tree-based models or want to incorporate target information in linear models such as logistic regression."

    "Covariance is a statistical measure that assesses the degree to which two variables random variables move together. It measures the direction and strength of the relationship between two variables. It can be used to determine whether there is a positive or negative association between two variables. A positive covariance means that the variables tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance means they tend to move in opposite directions.\n",
