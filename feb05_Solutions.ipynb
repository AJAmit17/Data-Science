    "Answer: In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.

    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, usually a class. This helps to hide the complexity of the system and protect the data from external access, ensuring that it is accessed and modified only through a well-defined interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of representing complex real-world entities as simplified models in code. This involves identifying the essential properties and behavior of an entity and ignoring the irrelevant details. Abstraction makes the code more manageable and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: Inheritance is the ability of a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, called the parent or superclass. Inheritance allows the creation of a hierarchy of classes that share common functionality while allowing for customization and specialization of behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. This means that a single method or property can behave differently depending on the context in which it is used. Polymorphism allows for more flexible and adaptable code."

The _\\_init_\\_() function takes the self parameter as its first argument, which refers to the instance of the object being created."

    "Answer: In object-oriented programming (OOP), \"self\" is a special keyword that refers to the current instance of a class. It is used to access and manipulate the attributes and methods of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, objects are created from classes, and each object has its own set of attributes and methods. When a method is called on an object, the method needs to know which object it is operating on. This is where \"self\" comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a method is called on an object, the object itself is passed to the method as the first argument. By convention, this argument is usually named \"self\" to indicate that it refers to the current instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using \"self\" allows methods to access and modify the attributes of the object that they are called on. It also allows methods to call other methods of the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, \"self\" is an important concept in OOP because it helps to ensure that methods operate on the correct object and can access and manipulate its attributes and methods as needed."
